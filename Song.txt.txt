What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you


My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
